- 👋 Hey there! I’m @ReginaKirana  
- 👀 Super curious about Data and all the cool stuff around it  
- 🌱 Currently diving into the world of Data (and hoping my brain keeps up 😆)  
- 📫 You can find me on Instagram: @regina.kirana and on Medium @reilyxe
  where I share my thoughts on piano, code, and whatever else sparks my interest! 🎶💡  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I only like 3 fruits—mango, orange, and banana. The rest? Meh, not my vibe 🍊🥭
